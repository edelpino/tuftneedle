<h1>Tuft &amp; Needle</h1>

<h2 align=center>&amp;Introduction</h2>

<p>Thank you for your interest in joining the team at Tuft & Needle! This Rails application is a very small sampling of the kind of application that you would be working on as a developer at T&N. We've designed a few features for you to work through that will help us get a feel for where you are in your journey as a developer and will hopefully give you some small insight into what it's like to work with us. This application has basic pages setup to <%= link_to 'create an Order', new_order_path %> of mattresses and view the details of that Order. Below are some enhancements to the application to work through. You may choose any or all of these features to work on. Feel free to add or subtract anything you want from this application from gems, to the database schema, to business logic and tests. A cucumber suite as well as a mini test suite has been started and may be extended if you choose.</p>

<h3>(1) Customer views items in cart grouped by product</h3>

<pre>
In order to provide a clear shopping experience
As a customer adding multiple items to my shopping cart
I want to see the products I've added, that are the same, grouped together

Given the following products
- King Mattress
- Queen Mattress
- Twin Mattress

When I select "King Mattress $700.00"
And I click "Add to Cart"
Then I should see "King Mattress $700.00" in my shopping cart

When I select "King Mattress $700.00"
And I click "Add to Cart"
Then I should see "(2) King Mattress $1400.00" in my shopping cart
</pre>

<h3>(2) Customer experience representative views order list</h3>

<pre>
In order to view all of the recent orders
As a customer experience representative on my dashboard
I want to see a list of all the recent orders

Given 5 recent orders
When I am on the dashboard page
And I click "Orders"
Then I should see a list in the following format:
  | Order Number | Customer | Date Created |
  | 1            | Jane Doe | 01/01/2017   |

<h3>(3) Customer experience representative views sales channel for an order</h3>

<pre>
In order to see where an order originated from
As a customer experience representative viewing the details of an order
I want to see the sales channel for that order

- For an order placed by a customer the sales channel should be 'Online'
- For an order placed by a customer experience representative the sales channel should be 'CX'
- For an order placed in a retail store the sales channel should be 'Retail'

Given an order placed Online
When I am on the detail page for that order
Then I should see the sales channel 'Online' reflected

Given an order placed by a customer service representative
When I am on the detail page for that order
Then I should see the sales channel 'CX' reflected

When I am on the detail page for that order
Then I should see the sales channel 'Retail' reflected
</pre>

<h3>(4) Customer experience representative views orders list sorted by sales channel</h3>

<pre>
In order to see orders by different sales channels
As a customer experience representative viewing the orders list
I want to filter the order list by sales channel

Given an order placed Online
And an order placed by CX
And I am viewing the orders lists
When I filter the list by 'Online' orders
Then I should see Online orders
And I should not see CX orders
</pre>
